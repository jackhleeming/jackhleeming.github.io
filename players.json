        "bio": "While relatively new to golf, Cameron is learning quickly. Known for his gentle, albeit aggressive draw, Cameron won’t shy away from whipping out his willy on the tee box and fraudulently chucking birdie down on the scorecard. With impeccable technique and an athletic bod, you start to wonder why his handicap is sitting at 47.8? It’s only a matter of time until you realise... it’s his absolutely shocking attitude. A missed three footer on green 1 and you know he’s tilted for the rest of the round. Can he keep his head strong and get his handicap sub-40? Or will he be forever doomed with the guilt and reputation that comes with being a very high handicapper.",

        "bio": "With the second best handicap in the tournament and a balls deep investment in cryptocurrency, what’s not to like about this competitor. Will’s humble golfing origins began at the prestigious Saint Kentigern Golfing Academy. Not only did he learn how to elegantly swing a golf club, he mastered the art of lying down on the green to vigorously line up a two foot putt. Having recently landed ashore from years on the superyachts, stable ground seems to be bringing results to his golfing game. Will hands in counter after counter, and we all know he has what it takes, but can he execute?",
